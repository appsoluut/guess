# Guess the number
Guess the number game written in Rust. The game will generate a secret number that you need to guess. Every guess will give you a hint if your guess is too big or to small. When the correct number has been guessed, you'll get a "You win!" message and the game will quit.

## How to compile
Checkout this branch and run the `cargo run` command to immediately start playing the game. Running `cargo build` will generate the binary for your platform.

## Disclaimer
This is nothing serious at all, just a small test of getting used to the Rust language and its tools.
